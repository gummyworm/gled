OpenGL client for neovim.

### What's done:
The rendering library that will be implemented by the client is working.  The library exposes a simple interface for updating the screen buffer.

### To Do:
Integrate msgpack-rpc for I/O (from the Qt neovim client - https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt).
